# CptS327FinalProject
Final Project for CptS327. For this project I created a two factor authentication program from scratch. The user enters their email and password and an email is sent to the user to verify their identity

I used PHP and MySQL for this project. For the scope of this rpoject I hosted a local server using XAMPP but this could be expanded to a WAN server if so desired.

A Demo Video for this Porject can be found in the link under FinalDemoVideo.txt. In this demo video I show the functionality of the project, why I decided to make this project, and a walkthrough of the code.
